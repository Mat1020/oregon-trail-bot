After the code is done with its job, you should keep on mind on...

1. Enter "n" everytime you are at a landmark.
2. Spam the space bar: sometimes you get messages which can slow you down.

When you get to choose where to go next, select "1"

When you get to choose where to go next again, select "2"

When you are at "2", select "2" again and enter "y"
